THE PREMIER LEAGUE QUIZ

Hello,

![image](https://github.com/cmoynan/The-Premier-League-Quiz/assets/150179658/6c417846-dddd-4b84-afe6-309830d797fb)

Welcome to my my Premier league quiz website. This site is a simple quiz. There is a total of 30 questions but each time the quiz is started you will get a 10 out of the 30 questions in random order. You get feedback if you answer the question correct or incorrectly and once you have answered 10 questions you will get your result.

FEATURES :
The site is a simple enough quiz.

Each time a question is answered it provides feedback to the user if they got the question correct or incorrect.

There is a question tracker that indicates to the user what question they're currently on also.

Once 10 questions are answered it will give the user the amount of correct answers out of 10. On the result page they will be presented with a restart button which will refresh the webpage and give the users a new set of questions. There is 30 questions so the probability of getting the exact same questions in the same order is very slim and this will keep the users interested.

The Poppins font is useed to create a more fun view of the site and the background colors on the pages give it a cartoon like view.

The site is functional and accessible over all screen devices and below is a screenshot of the AMI responsive Website

TESTING :

I have completed the quiz multiple times to ensure all functions run correctly and that there are no bugs. Biggest test was to make sure that questions never repeated in the same session. There was a number of Bugs in the Java code at times from more than 10 questions being asked to Questions not displaying to random questions not working but all have been fixed.

Tested HTML on the W3c Markup Validator and got no errors.

Tested the CSS on W3c CSS validator and no errors were found.

CREDITS :

The ShuffleArray function is from the stack overflow website . I was unable to get the randomisation of questions to work without repeating so copied this code from there.
